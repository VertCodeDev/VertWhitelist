A global per-server whitelist controllable from anywhere.

### Information

**What is VertWhitelist?**

VertWhitelist is a whitelist plugin that creates a synced whitelist between different servers, they just have to match
serverID (Can be changed in the config).

For example:
You set all the hub servers their id to `lobbies`, now when you type /whitelist on lobbies it will whitelist them all.

**But what if you want to whitelist 1 of the lobby but want the other lobbies to keep being unwhitelisted?**

Join that specific lobby and type /whitelist on.
(/whitelist on will only enable the whitelist for the server you are on)
